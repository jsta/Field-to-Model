### add header image?

Welcome to the 2nd NGEE Arctic Field-to-Model Workshop! In this two and a half day workshop,
we hope to introduce the basics of several different models used across the project, with 
breakout groups featuring three major modeling themes for the Arctic. Following the project's 
tradition of bringing modelers to the field, our goal is to bring empiricists to the models
and facilitate a better understanding of model capabilities, approaches, and limitations.
