Getting Started
====================

Follow these instructions to set up your environment for the workshop. This
workshop uses Docker containers to simplify installation of models and visualization
tools. Both the models and visualization tools can have complex dependencies and prerequisites
that need to be available on your computer. Docker containers allow us to simplify installation 
across computers and operating systems by providing a single "bundle" that contains the models,
visualization tools, and their dependencies. 

We have pre-built Docker images for the models and visualization tools, which
can be pulled from Docker Hub.

.. caution:: 
    If you prefer to build the images locally, instructions are provided in the :ref:`container-setup` section.
    It will take quite some time, and we strongly recommend using the pre-built containers.

Required software:
--------------------------

You will need the following software:

* Docker Desktop - though note you may need an institutional license.
* git

Optionally, you will need a 3D visualization tool: one of ParaView or VisIt.  VisIt is a little more intuitive to new users if you have never used either one and is sufficient for 90% of what we will do; ParaView is preferred for viewing complex 3D meshes.
This will be most useful for the ATS section of this Workshop.
  
Docker
^^^^^^

`Download Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_

.. admonition:: Windows

    Installation for Windows can be difficult since WSL 2 is required for the current version of Docker Desktop, so it is important to begin this process well before the short-course. If given the choice during installation, choose WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V.

    To manually update WSL 2:

    * Open a terminal or Powershell.
    * Update WSL ``wsl --update``
    * Install WSL ``wsl --install``  |nbsp| |nbsp| **Note: The process will take awhile and prompt you for an account creation**
    * Verify install using ``wsl --list``. You should see something like "Ubuntu".
    * Set default WSL ``wsl --set-default-version 2``

.. admonition:: macOS

    Download and install the .dmg file for your silicon type, whether Intel (older) or Apple (M1 and newer).

.. admonition:: Linux

    Docker provides instructions for adding DEB package repositories, then installing through apt-get for Ubuntu, Debian, and related distributions.  They also provide RPMs for RHEL8 & 9 and Fedora, and pacman for Arch.

.. seealso::

    * `WSL Installation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package>`_
    * `WSL Troubleshooting Guide <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#installation-issues>`_

Git
^^^

* **Mac OSX**: git is included in the *command line tools*, installed via ``xcode-select --install``, or in XCode itself.
* **Linux**: git is included as a standard package under most package managers, e.g. ``sudo apt-get install git``.
* **Windows**: See `Git Downloads <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git>`_. Note that the GitHub Desktop is also an option for Windows users and provides a GUI.


Clone Field-to-Model repository for the workshop
-------------------------------------------------

.. code::

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ngee-arctic/field-to-model
    cd field-to-model

This step downloads all of the scripts and infrastructure we have developed for the workshop,
it should take a couple minutes to complete.

Download Docker containers
----------------------------

The workshop uses two Docker containers: one for running the models and another
for visualization.

The model container has the following models available:

- ELM (Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model)    
- TEM (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model)    
- ATS (Advanced Terrestrial Simulator)

The model container is ~1.6GB on Docker Hub, and the visualization container is 
~2.1GB on Docker Hub.

Once you have the containers downloaded, you can run them on your local machine
with the following commands:

.. code::
    
    docker pull yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:models-main-latest
    docker pull yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:vis-main-latest

You will also need to set up a few docker volumes for the workshop:

.. code::

    docker volume create inputdata
    docker volume create output

Docker volumes act as additional 'drives' available on your computer that we
can use to store all of the ELM model input and output in the same places across
platforms (e.g., Windows vs mac). 

Get the workshop data
------------------------------

E3SM/ELM input data needed for the workshop can be downloaded by:

.. code::

    docker run -it --rm \
        -v $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
        -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
        yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:models-main-latest \
        /home/modex_user/tools/scripts/get_inputdata.sh

Test the containers
----------------------------

We have included a quick script to test whether the container images work for you:

.. code::

    docker run -it --rm \
        -v $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
        -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
        -v output:/mnt/output \
        yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:models-main-latest \
        /home/modex_user/tools/scripts/test_container.sh

If you get output that matches the output below, you've setup the container correctly:

.. code:: 

    ATS version 1.6.0_9f6f117d
    v0.8.3-42-g77038e0c
    Docker	E3SM  README.md  docs  model_examples  tools
    inputdata  output

Please take a moment to report if you were able to successfully get to this stage, or 
post any issues you are having here: https://github.com/NGEE-Arctic/Field-to-Model/issues/38
and we will try to have someone from the organizing team help you out before the workshop!


Launch the containers
----------------------------

Then once you have the images you can run them with the following commands
from the folder containing the field-to-model repo:

.. code::

    docker run -it --rm \
        -v  $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
        -v inputdata:/mnt/inputdata \
        -v output:/mnt/output \
        yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:models-main-latest /bin/bash

.. code::

    docker run -it --rm \
        -v  $(pwd):/home/modex_user \
        -v output:/mnt/output \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        yuanfornl/ngee-arctic-modex25:vis-main-latest

If you need a shell into the visualization container, you can open one using:

.. code::

    docker exec -it {CONTAINER_NAME} /bin/bash

You can find the value of ``{CONTAINER_NAME}`` by using:

.. code:: 

    docker ps

.. note:: TODO, write this...
    
    issue some kind of run command and get a shell in the container with 
    volumes mounted to the workshop data and the correct ports open...

    RPF - added information about this, but really what it needs is CONTAINER_NAME
    which can be determined by `docker ps`. Alternative option would be to specify 
    the container name at container startup in the docker run commands.
